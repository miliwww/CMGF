#Acknowledgement

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the authors of MS2CANet (Multiscale Spatial–Spectral Cross-Modal Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image and LiDAR Classification) for making their code framework publicly available. Our implementation benefits from their excellent open-source work, which laid a solid foundation for the development of this project.
